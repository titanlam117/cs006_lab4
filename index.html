                <b>About Me:</b> My name is Titan Lam. Currently, I am pursing a B.S. in Physics with a concentration in Applied Physics & Engineering.
                as a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I started in the year 2019 and began winter quarter. 
                I attended high school at Valley View High School in Moreno Valley, California. I plan on looking for an internship or research experience
                in Computer Hardware Engineering and find a career related to such.

            <h3>My Hometown</h3>
            <p>
                My hometown is Moreno Valley, California and is a special place to me as I spent my entire life here so far.
                I have learned to love the people I met here such as my friends, teachers, and acquaintances as they makeup who I am today.
                Some of my fondest memories of this place are from my experiences in the schools I went to and the friends I hung out with.
                In terms of food and culture, it stems from Hispanics roots as the population is majority Hispanics. I enjoyed the Winter and Spring
                seasons as I enjoy the cold weather and rain. The mood and atmosphere of rain and cold weather is soothing to me and makes me feel comfortable.
                To be honest, there weren't alot of cool places in my hometown area. Although, there was a plaza next to my high school that I spent alot of time
                in after school with friends.

            <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                In terms of hobbies, I spend most of my time playing video games, reading, and finding new music. 
                Some of my favorite video games are Dota 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Overwatch, and GTA V. These games are my favorite because
                I have some of the best memories playing these games with my friends. For reading, I usually read webtoons or comics.
                My favorite webtoons are Solo Leveling, Sweet Home, and Bastard. Recently, I have been enjoying finding new music and have taken
                an interest in punk pop as I have found to enjoy Machine Gun Kelly's discography. For my interests, I enjoy reading up on new technology 
                that is being invented, computer parts/building, and recently have picked up keyboard building.

            <h3>UCR</h3>
            <p>
                My time at UCR has been mainly spent with my studies. I would go to either libaries and chill there doing homework or some studying. 
                Most of my time there would be spent preparing for labs and going over the lab manual for that day. Before COVID, I used to hang out with 
                some friends in the library where we would just enjoy each others company and help each other if possible on studying/homework.
                Most of my experiences as a Highlander come from outside of the school. Sometimes I would hang out with friends at the University plaza to get some food
                or go downtown to catch a movie. Even though I have been here for 4 years, I have never visted the Botanical Gardens. Hopefully, I get a chance to in the future.
